# Reaper-Scripts
A bunch of reaper scripts

Iâ€™m making various Reaper scripts to improve workflow on audio and music tasks. 

## List of Scripts

#### AV5_CycleGrid
Cycle through grid up or down by pressing 1 key.

#### AV5_TabtoTransient
Enable or Disable tab to transient. Install all 3 scripts and replace your keybinds for tab to next and tab to prev. You can use the complementary scripts by themselves and it will tab to item if no item selected and to transient if there are items selected.

#### AV5_DeleteTargetEnvOnTrack
Deletes all envelope points of "Trim Envelope" on selected track. You can configure to a different Envelope, then copy and paste and change the first line to another envelope and use both copies of the script independenly.

#### AV5_NewProject_Random
Create a new project with random tempo, grid, time signature, number of tracks, name of tracks and track colors. Configure on first lines of the script to true or false the parameter you want to randomize. Lite version included.

#### AV5_RandomCursorMoveGrid
Move the cursor 1 unit in the script randomly between left and right. 50% chance.

#### AV5_RandomGrid
Set a random grid from the list of possible grids. Configure to include swing or add/remove grid sizes to the pool.

#### AV5_SendItemToProjectTab
Send selected items to the next project tab and sort them all in one track one after another. Configure first lines to add a separation time between items and number of tabs you want the script to jump.
