HOW TO USE:

Load the Toggle script in actions and set a hotkey or place it on a toolbar. Then load the complementary scripts (TabTransientNext, TabTransientPrev) with the hotkeys you want for tabbing to next item/transient and previous item/transient respectively. So yeah, the complementary scripts replace your current tab hotkeys.

You can use the complementary scripts by themselves so it tabs to item when no item selected and it tabs to transient when selected.

NOTE:
It works on Mac and the default installation path. It needs testing for Windows. If you use Windows and want to help test it, set enableDebug to true and contact me so I can work on it.


The method I used to avoid using extensions is replacing content of scripts via Lua .io, so it depends on where you install your scripts. I can do a video explaining how it works, I think I need to go through a couple of iterations before having a solid version.
