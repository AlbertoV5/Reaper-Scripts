###TOGGLE TAB TO TRANSIENT

####HOW TO USE:

1. Load the "AV5_ToggleTabToTransient.lua" Script.
2. Then load the complementary scripts: "AV5_TabTransientNext.lua", "AV5_TabTransientPrev.lua"
3. Assign the hotkeys you want for tabbing to next item/transient and previous item/transient respectively. This means that the complementary scripts replace your current tab hotkeys.

You can use the complementary scripts by themselves so it tabs to item when no item selected and it tabs to transient when selected.

Update 1.2: The complementary scripts now tab to next item in current track. The toggle tab script was optimized. It should work in both Windows and Mac.
