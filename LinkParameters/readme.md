Instructions: Config Flags and Globals on the script. Create a new track in Reaper and select it. Add a new FX and run this script.

![Demo](demo1.gif)

To do: Create pop up menu to deal with flags and globals or .ini file.
To do: Multichannel routing and pin mapping (that's probably a different script).

NOTE: Works with VST, VST3. JS not supported yet.
